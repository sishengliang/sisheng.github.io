I will join the Computer Science Department at Central Michigan University as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. I earned my Ph.D. degree from the School of Computing at Clemson University under the supervision of Dr. Zhenkai Zhang. My primary area of research is side-channel security and hardware security, which I have a particular interest in.
