I joined the Computer Science Department at Central Michigan University as an Assistant Professor in the fall of 2024. I earned my Ph.D. degree from the School of Computing at Clemson University under the supervision of Dr. Zhenkai Zhang. My primary research areas are side-channel security and hardware security, in which I have a particular interest.
