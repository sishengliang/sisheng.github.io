I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at Central Michigan University. I received my Ph.D. degree from the School of Computing at Clemson University under the supervision of Dr. Zhenkai Zhang. My primary research areas are side-channel security and hardware security, in which I have a particular interest.

I have RA positions, please contact me if you are interested.  My email is liang4s AT cmich.edu.
